# Financial-Complaints-KPI-Dashboard- Tableau 
Tableau Financial Complaints dashboard is based on Real World Fake Data #RWFD which is helpful in creating real life dashboards.
This Dashboard Provides an Overview of Financial Complaints, Complaints by- Issue, By State, By Product, Complaints Via Media And 
Complaints Disputed.

1. I have created 5 charts and 5 KPI's for Visualization
2. Used Different types of charts like Bar-Xharts, Dual-Axix Graphs, Doughnut Charts and the Hexagon Charts to represent the States.
4. Applied different Actions like filters, Highlights etc.
